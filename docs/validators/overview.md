# Validator Overview

Validators play a crucial role in the ETHGas ecosystem by participating in preconfirmation (preconf) commitments and earning rewards through gas trading opportunities.

## What is ETHGas for Validators?

ETHGas provides validators with the opportunity to:

- **Earn additional rewards** through preconfirmation commitments
- **Participate in gas trading** without complex trading strategies
- **Delegate to specialized builders** for optimized block building
- **Use automated pricing** through our default pricer
- **Maintain validator operations** while earning extra income

## Validator Roles

### Preconfirmation Commitments
Validators can commit to including specific transactions in their blocks, earning fees from traders who want guaranteed transaction inclusion.

### Block Building
Validators can either:
- **Self-build blocks** with their own infrastructure
- **Delegate to specialist builders** for optimized performance
- **Use ETHGas fallback builder** for reliable backup

### Fee Collection
Validators earn from:
- **Priority fees** from included transactions
- **MEV opportunities** from block ordering
- **Preconfirmation fees** from traders
