# ETHGas Documentation

**The End of Latency. The Beginning of Realtime.**

Welcome to the comprehensive ETHGas documentation. This repository contains the complete technical documentation for ETHGas - the real-time infrastructure layer that transforms Ethereum's blockspace into a structured, liquid, and tradable asset class.

## üåü What is ETHGas?

ETHGas introduces realtime settlements and blockspace futures to Ethereum, enabling a blazingly fast, customizable experience for everyone. We're delivering the Ethereum of the Future, Today.

### Our Vision: Realtime Ethereum

ETHGas is building the foundational financial market for Ethereum's blockspace, transforming the chaotic, unpredictable auction for transaction inclusion into a structured, liquid, and tradable asset class.

### Our Four Pillars

- **Instant Ethereum** - 3.1ms transaction confirmation times
- **Blockspace Trading** - Trade entire blocks and inclusion preconfirmations
- **Validator Integration** - Automated fee optimization and builder infrastructure
- **Developer Tools** - Professional-grade APIs and real-time data feeds

## üõí Our Product Suite

### Whole Blocks & Sequencing Rights
Primary and secondary markets where validators can sell entire blocks, conferring building/sequencing rights to the owner.

### Inclusion Preconfirmations
Commitments where validators guarantee to include your transactions within a specific block, with bids for fixed amounts of blockspace.

### Execution Preconfirmations
Like inclusion preconfs but with guarantees of specific state or results, requiring both blockspace and specific trade/bundle requirements.

### Base Fee Futures
Calendar futures for specific slots enabling traders to long or short the base fee with cash settlement.
